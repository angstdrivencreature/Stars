            <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
              It is the closest planet to the Sun at a distance of about 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) or 0.39 AU.</p>
            <p>Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet. Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.</p>
            <p>Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K).
              Atoms that are blasted off the surface by the solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts create Mercury's exosphere.</p>
            <p>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.
              Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system.
              No evidence for life has been found on Mercury.
              Daytime Temperatures can reach 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit) and drop to -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit) at night.
              It is unlikely life (as we know it) could survive on this planet.</p>
